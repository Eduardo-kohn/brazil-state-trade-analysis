# Brazil State Trade Analysis

Analysis of Brazil’s state-level exports and imports using trade indicators, econometric modeling, and dashboards.

---

## Technical Stack
- Python (pandas, statsmodels)
- SQL  
- Power BI  
- Econometrics  

---

## Project Scope
- State-level trade dataset (multi-year)  
- Export and import indicators  
- Descriptive and econometric analysis  
- State performance comparison  
- Dashboards  

---

## Research Questions
- How do exports and imports vary across Brazilian states?
- Which states depend on specific export sectors?
- Which states perform above or below model predictions?
- How have trade patterns changed over time?

---

## Methodological Components
- Data cleaning and harmonization  
- Construction of trade indicators (exports, imports, trade balance)  
- Export concentration metrics (HHI)  
- Cross-sectional and panel regression models  
- Residual analysis  
- Power BI dashboards

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Download trade data by state  
   - Gather GDP and population data  

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning and standardization  
   - Panel dataset construction  
   - Log transformations  

3. **Indicator Construction**
   - Export per capita  
   - Trade balance  
   - Export concentration (HHI)  

4. **Econometric Analysis**
   - Cross-sectional OLS  
   - Fixed effects panel models  
   - Diagnostic checks  

5. **Visualization**
   - State comparisons  
   - Structural indicators  
   - Power BI dashboard
